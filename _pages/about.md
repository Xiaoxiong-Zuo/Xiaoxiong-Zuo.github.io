I am currently a Joint Ph.D. student at **Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)**, formerly at **National Astronomical Observatories, CAS (NAOC)**.

My research focuses on applying **Deep Learning** and **Foundation Models** to astronomical data processing. I am passionate about AI algorithms and currently looking for job opportunities in China.
