I am a Ph.D. Candidate at **National Astronomical Observatories, CAS (NAOC)**, advised by Prof. [Chenzhou Cui](https://www.lamost.org/~cb/), and currently a visiting Ph.D. student at **Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU)**, working with Prof. [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/contact-page/daniel-gruen-ba89d54b.html).

My research focuses on applying **Deep Learning** and **Foundation Models** to astronomical data processing. I am passionate about AI algorithms and currently looking for job opportunities.
